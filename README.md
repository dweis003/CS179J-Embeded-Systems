Code in main.c was written by me, bit.h is code from CS120B, and 
croutine.c, heap_1.c, list.c, port.c, queue.c, tasks.c, and timers.c 
are all files needed to run FreeRTOS. 

# CHIP1 Files
Code in main.c was written by me, bit.h is code from 120B, io.c and io.h 
are CS120B files needed to drive the LCD. Croutine.c, heap_1.c, list.c, 
port.c, queue.c, tasks.c, and timers.c are all files needed to run FreeRTOS.
Lastly, eeprom.c and eeprom.h are preexisting AVR files needed for use 
of the EEPROM.
